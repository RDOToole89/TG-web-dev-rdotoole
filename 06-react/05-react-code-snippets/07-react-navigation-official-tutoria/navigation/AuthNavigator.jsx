// Adjusting header stylesâ€‹

// There are three key properties to use when customizing the style of your header: headerStyle,headerTintColor, and headerTitleStyle.

// headerStyle: a style object that will be applied to the View that wraps the header. If you set backgroundColor on it, that will be the color of your header.

// headerTintColor: the back button and title both use this property as their color. In the example below, we set the tint color to white (#fff) so the back button and the header title would be white.

//headerTitleStyle: if we want to customize the fontFamily, fontWeight and other Text style properties for the title, we can use this to do it.

// There are a couple of things to notice here:

// On iOS, the status bar text and icons are black, and this doesn't look great over a dark-colored background. We won't discuss it here, but you should be sure to configure the status bar to fit with your screen colors as described in the status bar guide.

// The configuration we set only applies to the home screen; when we navigate to the details screen, the default styles are back. We'll look at how to share options between screens now.
