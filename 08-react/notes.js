// Basically what React does is take two trees and produces the difference between those trees
// Accept on the first render because there is nothing to compare it to.

// In Web Dev we have the Virtual Dom and in Native the Shadow Tree (sort of)
// The concept is the same in that React is responsible for managing the differences between states
// and does this by comparing tree like achitectures.
