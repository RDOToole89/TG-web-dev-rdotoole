// Same goals as OOP

// Write clear + understabdable code
// Easy to extend
// Easy to maintain
// Memory efficient
// Dry

// Functional programming seperates the DATA of a program and the BEHAVIOUR of a program
// Main pillar of Functionl Programming is:

// PURE FUNCTIONS => All Object created in FP are immutable
// once something is created it can't be changed
